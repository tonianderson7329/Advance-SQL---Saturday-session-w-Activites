# Advance-SQL---Saturday-session-w-Activites

##SUMMARY

in the course, I learned how to connect SQl databases using Python with SQLAlchemy ORM. I constantly was getting a OpertionalError due to the password. I have changed my password within MySQL and also created a new SQL Database to create a new username and password tp bypass this error but it was a no go situation. The Python notebooks that display Not Resolved are due to this error.  However, I was able to complete all other activites as it covered Classes, Objects, Tables creation and updating them with values in Python.

Mentioned what and how classes are defined in Python. Class is a set or category of things having some property or attribute in common and differentiated from others by kind, type, or quality. Used (__init__) which is a reseved method in python classes. It is known as a constructor in object oriented concepts. Used Self as a keyword that could access the attributes and methods of the class. Creating Tables (__tablenames__) is used when you want to construct the table.
